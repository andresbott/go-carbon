Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project

This contributor agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Us, by digitally

This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it.

## 1. Definitions

means an entity which is not a natural person. "Affiliates" means other Legal Entities that control, are controlled 
by, or under common control with that Legal Entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such Legal Entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (ii)

including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including 
any extensions by You.

"Material" means the work of authorship which is made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers

## 2. Grant of Rights

### 2.1 Copyright Assignment

(a) At the time the Contribution is Submitted, You assign to Us all right, title, and interest worldwide in all 
Copyright covering the Contribution; provided that this transfer is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(b) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) cannot be assigned by You to Us, You grant to Us a 
perpetual, worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under such non-assigned rights, 
with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to practice such non-assigned rights, including, 
but not limited to, the right to reproduce, modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution; provided 
that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(c) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) can neither be assigned nor licensed by You to Us, 
You irrevocably waive and agree never to assert such rights against Us, any of our successors in interest, or any of 
our licensees, either direct or indirect; provided that this agreement not to assert is conditioned upon compliance 
with Section 2.3.

(d) Upon such transfer of rights to Us, to the maximum extent possible, We immediately grant to You a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under such rights covering the Contribution,
with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify, display, perform, 
and distribute the Contribution. The intention of the parties is that this license will be as broad as possible 
and to provide You with rights as similar as possible to the owner of the rights that You transferred. 
This license back is limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the Material.

### 2.2 Patent License

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims which You (or Your Affiliates)
own, control or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers 
of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and 
the Contribution in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This license is granted only 
to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this license 
is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

### 2.3 Outbound License

As a condition on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, We agree to license the Contribution only under the 
terms of the license or licenses which We are using on the Submission Date for the Material or the 
following additional licenses: AGPL, MIT, Apache 2.0
(including any right to adopt any future version of a license if permitted).

### 2.4 Moral Rights. 

If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive 
and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, 
either direct or indirect.

2.5 Our Rights. You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material 
and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.

reserved by You.
