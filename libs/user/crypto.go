		// versions. "$2a$" has a known bug, "$2x$" was added as a
		// migration path for systems with "$2a$" prefix and still has a
		// bug, and only "$2y$" should be used by modern systems. The bug
		// has something to do with handling of 8-bit characters. Since
		// both "$2a$" and "$2x$" are deprecated, we are handling them the
		// same way as "$2y$", which will yield correct results for 7-bit
		// character passwords, but is wrong for 8-bit character
		// passwords. You have to upgrade to "$2y$" if you want sant 8-bit
		// character password support with bcrypt. To add to the mess,
		// OpenBSD 5.5. introduced "$2b$" prefix, which behaves exactly
		// like "$2y$" according to the same source.
