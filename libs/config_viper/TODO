* read config dirs
* user space config in .config
    * write
* defaulf config lccation
* write to location
* dont fail if not config is provided ( option to make config file optional/mandatory)

* in the options option to specifi a file as key value and have that loaded
    e.g. to load a secret from file


* why i dont use viper:
 - not really possible to make a 12 factor confit to unmarshal
 - not possible to unmarshal config sections
 - does not support config.d pattern
 - i wanted to add validation like required
